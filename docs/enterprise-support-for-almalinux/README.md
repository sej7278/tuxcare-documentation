## **Extended Security Updates**

Extended Security Updates (ESU) for AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux extends the lifecycle of specific minor versions by delivering both prolonged security updates for High and Critical vulnerabilities as well as FIPS-compliant security patches enabling greater stability and security for your Linux deployments.

### ESU lifecycle

AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux provide a 10-year lifecycle with a new minor release arriving every 6 months, bringing new features until the fifth year. Each of the minor releases is supported for 6 months. Customers who want to remain with the specific AlmaLinux or Rocky Linux minor release for longer can opt for Extended Security Updates (ESU).

ESU delivers an extended period of security fixes for critical and high-risk vulnerabilities for select minor versions, as well as the full suite of five FIPS-validated modules (kernel, openssl, libcrypt, nss and gnutls) and FIPS-compliant security patches for FIPS-certified Linux deployments. The product also unlocks commercial use of the FIPS-validated packages.

Extended Security Updates are currently available for AlmaLinux 9.2, AlmaLinux 9.6, Rocky Linux 9.6, and planned support for 9.10. This provision ensures that a given minor release continues to receive essential updates, allowing customers to avoid upgrading every six months and test/certify their applications against the next minor version at their own pace.

### Vulnerability coverage

TuxCare employs the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3) to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities. Our severity rating system for patching vulnerabilities integrates both NVD scoring and vendor scoring (when available). When the vendor's score is lower than the NVD score, we give priority to the NVD score.

ESU prioritises security patches for High and Critical CVE's and bug fixes - but to help our customers comply with regulations such as FedRAMP, HIPAA and PCI-DSS - TuxCare also provides Low and Moderate severity security patches where possible (or otherwise mitigations/analysis) and where breaking changes aren't introduced, going back as far as November 2025. Additional Low/Moderate CVE patches can be purchased if required - speak to your Account Manager about our 10 CVE bundles.

### FIPS-compliant security patches

ESU enables continuous security for FIPS-certified AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux 9 deployments by offering FIPS-compliant security patches for the FIPS-validated [kernel, openssl, libcrypt, nss and gnutls packages](https://tuxcare.com/fips-for-almalinux/). These patches [do not change the validated cryptography](https://tuxcare.com/blog/the-dilemmas-of-fips-140-3-compliance/). They are suitable for organizations that don't require strict FIPS-certified implementations that are static and never patched (i.e. military or intelligence agencies). In case of a cryptographic vulnerability that will require a security patch that changes the validated cryptography, we will fix it by delivering a new packaged module. This module will undergo an expedited FIPS 140-3 re-validation to ensure it is attested to conform to FIPS 140-3 requirements.

### Target response times

Aligning with many industry standards and regulatory requirements, TuxCare is committed to delivering timely security updates. For instance, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates that all 'High' vulnerabilities (CVSS score of 7.0+) must be addressed within 30 days. Other regulations and standards, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare organizations or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) for government agencies, uphold similar requirements.
We aim to deliver security patches for Critical and High-risk vulnerabilities (CVSS 7+) within 14 days from when the vulnerabilities become publicly disclosed. This rapid response time significantly reduces the window of opportunity for potential attackers and meets most security regulation requirements.

### Supported packages

ESU provides updates for a comprehensive list of packages integral to server operations - the complete list of over 6,000 packages in BaseOS and AppStream, plus a few more - thus providing maximum security for your operating system. You can view the full list of supported packages, as well as get detailed information on the patched CVEs, here: [https://cve.tuxcare.com/](https://cve.tuxcare.com/)

Support for additional packages can be provided on request.

### Errata advisories

ESU provides qualified security and selected bug-fix errata advisories across all architectures. They can help users track which Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are resolved and which bugs have been addressed. You can view the full list of released advisories here [https://cve.tuxcare.com/els/releases](https://cve.tuxcare.com/els/releases)

### OVAL patch definitions

Leveraging Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) patch definitions with OVAL-compatible tools, e.g. OpenSCAP, users can accurately check their systems for the presence of vulnerabilities:

* ESU 9.2 OVAL: [https://security.tuxcare.com/oval/els_os/almalinux9.2esu/oval.xml](https://security.tuxcare.com/oval/els_os/almalinux9.2esu/oval.xml)
* ESU 9.6 OVAL: [https://security.tuxcare.com/oval/els_os/tuxcare9.6esu/oval.xml](https://security.tuxcare.com/oval/els_os/tuxcare9.6esu/oval.xml)

### CSAF data

Vulnerability scanner vendors may prefer the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0 machine-readable format:

* ESU 9.2 CSAF advisories: [https://security.tuxcare.com/csaf/v2/els_os/almalinux9.2esu/advisories/](https://security.tuxcare.com/csaf/v2/els_os/almalinux9.2esu/advisories/)

### GnuPG Keys

The TuxCare ESU/FIPS packages and repositories are cryptographically signed with a GPG key, so you can verify the legitimacy of the software you download and the source of the download. The details of our key are below:

* Public key: rsa4096/8D50EB66 (2023-03-06)
  * Fingerprint: FAD7 8590 81D0 738B 7A82  8496 D07B F2A0 8D50 EB66
  * ID: TuxCare (Software Signing Key) <packager@tuxcare.com>
  * Installation location: /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-TuxCare
  * Download link: [RPM-GPG-KEY-TuxCare](https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/RPM-GPG-KEY-TuxCare)

### Installing tuxctl

**Requirements**

* AlmaLinux 9.2 or AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 9.6 operating system (download images from [here](https://tuxcare.com/almalinux-enterprise-support/get-almalinux/))
* x86_64 or aarch64 architecture
* Extended Security Updates license key (should be obtained from [portal.tuxcare.com](https://portal.tuxcare.com))
* Internet access

`tuxctl` is the setup tool for TuxCare's Enterprise Support for AlmaLinux, which will configure your system to receive patches from the TuxCare repositories. To install `tuxctl` you need to install the `tuxcare-release` package first. This package contains the TuxCare repo definitions, TuxCare GPG key and the `tuxctl` setup tool. Run one of the following as root:

For 9.2:

```text
# dnf -y install https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/tuxcare-release-latest-9.2.noarch.rpm
```

For 9.6:

```text
# dnf -y install https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/tuxcare-release-latest-9.6.noarch.rpm
```

The second step is to activate your license on the system. You should run the `tuxctl` tool as root with your ESU license key provided as a command line argument like so:

```text
# tuxctl --license-key XXXXXXXXXX
```

This tool will do the following:

1. Check your OS and architecture
2. Check your license key for validity and purchased extensions
3. Check if your system is already registered
4. Register to CloudLinux Network
5. Obtain a token to access the restricted TuxCare repos
6. Enable the TuxCare ESU repo
7. Switch the default AlmaLinux repos to use repo.tuxcare.com
8. Import the TuxCare GPG key

After installation you'll see the following message:

```text
TuxCare installed successfully
```

This means your system is registered and ready to receive updates from TuxCare.
:::warning
If during installation something goes wrong then the `tuxctl` tool will show an error message and suggest how to handle it. For example, if your system is already registered you'll receive the following message:

```text
This server already has a TuxCare token installed
To force re-registration, please run the script with --force
```

Then you will have to run `tuxctl` like this:

```text
# tuxctl --force -l XXXXXXXXXX
```

:::

**Managing license usage**

To check if a server is already activated, you can run `tuxctl` and check for return code 0:

```text
# tuxctl -v
Server is registered with token <blah>
```

Or if not registered you will get a return code 1:

```text
# tuxctl -v
Server is not registered
```

If you are decommissioning a server and would like to de-register its license, you can run `tuxctl` like this and check for return code 0:

```text
# tuxctl -d
De-registration successful
```

**Upgrading**

ESU customers can upgrade between ESU releases, for example from 9.2 to 9.6 by editing the /etc/dnf/vars/tuxcare_releasever file to specify the new version, like so:

```text
# echo 9.6 > /etc/dnf/vars/tuxcare_releasever
# dnf upgrade
```

### Uninstalling tuxctl

To uninstall tuxctl, disable the ESU/FIPS functionality and revert to community repo's, you can run the following as root:

```text
# dnf -y remove tuxcare-release

# fips-mode-setup --disable

# sed -i \
  -e 's|https://repo.tuxcare.com/almalinux/|https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/|' \
  -e 's|^# mirrorlist|mirrorlist|' \
  -e 's|^baseurl|# baseurl|' \
  -e 's|$tuxcare_releasever/$tuxcare_token|$releasever|g' \
  -e 's|$tuxcare_releasever|$releasever|g' \
  -e '/^exclude/d' \
  /etc/yum.repos.d/almalinux*.repo

# sed -i \
  -e 's|https://repo.tuxcare.com/rockylinux/|http://dl.rockylinux.org/\$contentdir/|' \
  -e 's|^# mirrorlist|mirrorlist|' \
  -e 's|^baseurl|# baseurl|' \
  -e 's|$tuxcare_releasever/$tuxcare_token|$releasever|g' \
  -e 's|$tuxcare_releasever|$releasever|g' \
  -e '/^exclude/d' \
  /etc/yum.repos.d/rocky*.repo

# reboot
```

:::warning
Note that by disabling ESU, you will revert to tracking major version releases instead of sticking to a specific minor version, so you may be upgraded from 9.2 to 9.6 for example - a process you cannot undo.
:::

To completely remove the TuxCare packages, after following the above steps, run the following as root:

```text
# dnf remove *tuxcare*
```

In most cases this will be the end of the uninstallation procedure, however if you see an error message like the following, then you may have to use `grubby` or `grub2-reboot` or simply the grub menu, to reboot into a non-TuxCare kernel first:

```text
Error:
 Problem: The operation would result in removing the following protected packages: sudo, systemd, kernel-core, dnf
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate packages)
```

Then run the following:

```text
# dnf downgrade openssl libgcrypt gnutls nettle nss
# dnf remove kernel*tuxcare*
# dnf upgrade
```

### Enabling FIPS 140-3 mode

:::warning
Note that Rocky Linux 9.6 is a *vendor-affirmed OE* and has not been through the same FIPS lab testing as AlmaLinux, however the FIPS *modules* are the exact same packages used for both operating systems.
:::

First please ensure you have installed the `tuxcare-release` package as described above. If you haven't already registered your ESU license using `tuxctl` the next step will also do that for you.

To install the FIPS 140-3 validated ESU packages over the default ones and enable FIPS mode, please run these commands as root:

```text
# dnf -y upgrade
# fips-mode-setup --enable
# reboot
```

If you wish to only boot into the Active FIPS-validated kernel and not the security patched kernels or updates under CMVP review (only required in very high classification environments) you can use grubby like so:

```text
# dnf -y install kernel-5.14.0-284.11.1.el9_2.tuxcare.6
# grubby --set-default=/boot/vmlinuz-5.14.0-284.11.1.el9_2.tuxcare.6.$(uname -i)
```

:::warning
Note the aarch64 platform doesn't currently have FIPS-validated gnutls/libgcrypt/nss packages, only kernel and openssl for AlmaLinux 9.2

We also provide multilib i686 packages of the userspace modules in the x86_64 repo for backwards compatibility, note that these are not FIPS-validated but are built from the same source.
:::

Once you've logged in after the reboot, you can run these commands to confirm it worked (note the versions may be slightly different by the time you read this, see [version table](https://tuxcare.com/fips-for-almalinux/)):

```text
$ fips-mode-setup --check
FIPS mode is enabled.

$ update-crypto-policies --show
FIPS

$ update-crypto-policies --check
The configured policy matches the generated policy

$ uname -r
5.14.0-284.1101.el9_2.tuxcare.7.x86_64

$ openssl list -providers | grep -A3 fips
  fips
    name: OpenSSL FIPS Provider for AlmaLinux 9
    version: 3.0.7-1d2bd88ee26b3c90
    status: active
```

### NSS-FIPS and Java crypto APIs

#### Java crypto

Java has a fully abstract crypto API with a pluggable cryptographic implementation organized into
crypto Providers. Providers, as the name suggests, provide implementations for various crypto
algorithms. The providers are loaded using JRE's configuration, either system-wide or per
deployment, or can be loaded at application runtime.

The order of available crypto providers is important as methods such as
Cipher.getInstance(algorithm) without specifying the exact provider name (through second
parameter) will return a matching implementation from the first provider that implements that
crypto mechanism.

Some providers, like one of the default JDK providers – SunJCE – provide only the basic crypto
primitives. Others - like SunJSSE – provide higher level operations that rely on crypto primitives
implemented by other providers. Those operations are, for instance, those being part of TLS or
X509 standards in order to handle transport layer security or public key infrastructure.

#### FIPS compliant implementations

In order to use FIPS compliant and FIPS certified implementations of cryptographic mechanisms
the application should use a crypto provider that interfaces with a concrete implementation certified
to be FIPS compliant. Many 3rd party applications or libraries (packages) rely on the Provider
infrastructure and cede the choice of crypto implementations to the app/system maintainer.

Therefore in most cases the deployer – likely a sysadmin or devops – is free to choose an
appropriate set of crypto providers for the application.

OpenJDK for instance allows for configuring a PKCS11 provider which can interface with a native,  
system-wide crypto library – NSS and its PKCS11 implementation – libsoftokn3.so. This
implementation by tuxcare is FIPS compliant.

An alternative PKCS11 implementation is SoftHSM which uses OpenSSL underneath. However,
the cryptographic boundary is slightly shifted here. libsoftokn3 with NSS is FIPS certified while
softhsm library alone is not, although the underlying openssl is.

There are also alternative ways to interface with other system wide, FIPS compliant, native libs
such as OpenSSL however this would need extra effort to build and maintain other, 3rd party
providers, that are not readily available in the package repos and would have to be provided by the
maintainer of the end application.

#### Java's crypto API diagram

![Java Crypto Providers](/images/providers.webp)

#### SunPKCS11 provider

SunPKCS11 is a provider which interfaces, through JNI, with a native implementation that exposes
a PKCS11 crypto API, typically called a "token". Typically that would mean a hardware token – a
device that implements crypto operations and exposes a PKCS11 interface through a "driver" being
a native shared library.

#### NSS-FIPS implementation

NSS-FIPS implementation acts as a software token. It provides a PKCS11 interface like any USB
crypto token, a HSM or a smart card would, but the actual implementation is provided in software
using libnss3.

#### JSSE

JSSE provides TLS and PKI implementations and, if the provider set is properly configured, would
have to rely on cryptographic primitives provided by NSS-FIPS.

#### Alternative providers

So far NSS is the only crypto library that alone provides an "upwards-facing" PKCS11 API and
thus can be easily and seamlessly incorporated into a Java software solution. Other means include
using:

* softHSM

  Which is also a PKCS11 provider and relies on OpenSSL underneath, however, it doesn't itself fall
  within a FIPS cryptographic boundary of the system deliverables.

* conscrypt

  However, conscrypt became problematic to maintain having been hardwired to boringSSL by
  Google. Even though boringssl essentially has the same API as OpenSSL, conscrypt would require
  extra maintenance and as such is not provided as an AlmaLinux package.

* openssl-fips-java

  Maintained by Canonical but not available as a package (even in Ubuntu), this provider can be built
  to interface with the FIPS implementation of OpenSSL.

#### PKCS11-NSS-FIPS setup

As shown on the diagram, a PKCS11 provider needs to be configured in order to work with Java
crypto. A HSM or smart card would require a driver in form of a shared library.

For NSS specifically – OpenJDK provides several shorthand configuration attributes.

The configuration can either be done in the application's Java code by passing the config as a String  
argument or through environment or system-wide via configuration files.

#### System-wide config files

* `(...)/security/java.security`

  This file specifies the provider list and the order of providers. In non-fips mode this file will contain  
  the following:

  ```text
  security.provider.N=SunPKCS11 ${java.home}/lib/security/nss.cfg
  ```

  while in FIPS mode:

  ```text
  fips.provider.1=SunPKCS11 ${java.home}/conf/security/nss.fips.cfg
  ```

  Both directives configure a SunPKCS11 provider and point to the provider-specific configuration
  files

* `(...)/security/nss.fips.cfg`

  ```text
  name = NSS-FIPS
  ```

  The name which will be appended to "SunPKCS11-" identifying the configured provider

  Followed by nss-specific directives

  ```text
  nssLibraryDirectory = /usr/lib64
  nssSecmodDirectory = ${fips.nssdb.path}
  nssDbMode = readWrite
  nssModule = fips
  ```

  Instead of providing a full path to the NSS shared lib one needs only to point to a library directory
  containing NSS libraries.

#### SoftHSM configuration

The configuration of SoftHSM includes

* setting up a config file. If the Java app is used in non-root context (as it probably is) then the
config file needs to be user accessible and SOFTHSM2_CONF environment variable must point to
it.
* a keystore needs to be set up in the config file
* a SoftHSM "token" needs to be created within the keystore directory. It must be PIN protected,
therefore
* in order to use crypto primitves Java application needs to instantiate SoftHSM KeyStore object
and .init() it with the PIN.

#### Limiting non-FIPS algorithm implementations

Neither PKCS11 alone, nor NSS, does prevent library users from instantiating and using FIPS
unapproved algorithms. Application developers are also free to include any code within their
applications, including FIPS unapproved cryptographic algorithms in cryptographic context, or
using FIPS unapproved algos, like SHA-1 in non-cryptographic contexts, like file checksums or
lookup hashes.

NSS implements a notion of a FIPS indicator which allows the application's implementer to decide
what to do with a FIPS unapproved algorithms. Unlike openssl which bluntly fails if a non-fips
operation is requested.

The caveat – NSS's PKCS11 API does not provide a facility for querying the indicator as there can
be no such facility within PKCS11.

#### disabledAlgorithms directive

Certain algorithms from NSS (or any other PKCS11 provider) can be blacklisted in the provider's
config file (or by other means of configuring PKCS11). For instance DES based cipher mechanisms  
can be explicitly blocked using

```text
disabledMechanisms = {
        CKM_DES_ECB
        CKM_DES_ECB_ENCRYPT_DATA
        CKM_DES3_ECB
        CKM_DES3_ECB_ENCRYPT_DATA
        CKM_DES_CBC
        CKM_DES_CBC_ENCRYPT_DATA
        CKM_DES_CBC_PAD
        CKM_DES3_CBC
        CKM_DES3_CBC_ENCRYPT_DATA
        CKM_DES3_CBC_PAD
}
```

The above will not even appear on the mechanism list for this provider.

### Migrating from CentOS

This guide contains steps on how to upgrade from CentOS 7 or Stream 8 [ELS](https://tuxcare.com/endless-lifecycle-support/centos-stream-8-eol-support/) to AlmaLinux 9.2 [ESU](https://tuxcare.com/fips-for-almalinux/).

You will require an ESU license key from [https://tuxcare.com/buy/almalinux/](https://tuxcare.com/buy/almalinux/) or [https://tuxcare.com/buy/rockylinux/](https://tuxcare.com/buy/rockylinux/) or talk to your Account Manager about our ELS-to-ESU migration bundle offer.

:::warning
Ensure that you have a non-root user who can SSH and elevate privileges to root using su/sudo as this process will disable root SSH login. FIPS mode will also disable non-RSA SSH keys. Console access is recommended.
:::

Choose **one** of the migrations below (1a or 1b) based on your CentOS ELS version. Once you have migrated to AlmaLinux 8, the instructions for getting to 9.2 and enabling ESU/FIPS are the same.

**1A. Migrate CentOS 7.9 ELS to AlmaLinux 8.10**

```text
# update then disable els
yum -y update
dnf config-manager --set-disabled centos7*

# install elevate 7to8
yum install -y http://repo.almalinux.org/elevate/elevate-release-latest-el7.noarch.rpm
yum install -y leapp-upgrade leapp-data-almalinux
leapp preupgrade
leapp answer --section remove_pam_pkcs11_module_check.confirm=True
leapp upgrade
reboot
```

You will now be running AlmaLinux 8.10 and can skip ahead to step 2.

**1B. Migrate CentOS Stream 8 ELS to AlmaLinux 8.10**

```text
# update then disable els
dnf -y upgrade
dnf config-manager --set-disabled centos8stream-els

# install almalinux-deploy
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy/master/almalinux-deploy.sh
bash almalinux-deploy.sh -d
reboot
```

**2. Upgrade AlmaLinux 8.10 to 9.2**

```text
# clean up
sed -i '/^exclude=.*/d' /etc/yum.conf /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
dnf -y remove *leapp* elevate-release els-define
rm -rf  /lib/modules/3.10*

# disable root ssh in a portable way
echo PermitRootLogin no | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# install elevate 8to9
dnf -y install https://repo.almalinux.org/elevate/elevate-release-latest-el8.noarch.rpm
dnf -y install leapp-upgrade leapp-data-almalinux

# upgrade specifically to 9.2
export LEAPP_DISABLE_NET_NAMING_SCHEMES=1
leapp preupgrade --target=9.2
leapp upgrade --target=9.2
reboot
```

**3. Enable AlmaLinux 9.2 ESU repositories and FIPS mode**

```text
# clean up
sed -i '/^exclude=.*/d' /etc/yum.conf /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
dnf -y remove *leapp* elevate-release kernel-*.el8*

# enable esu+fips
dnf -y install https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/tuxcare-release-latest-9.2.noarch.rpm
tuxctl --license-key XXXXXXXXXX
dnf -y upgrade
fips-mode-setup --enable
reboot
```

## **Essential and Enhanced Support**

### 1. Introduction

In April 2023, TuxCare, a division of CloudLinux Inc., launched Enterprise Support for AlmaLinux, delivering a range of services for AlmaLinux workloads. It provides two levels of support, the essential level, focused on the operating system, and the enhanced support focused on applications. This document defines those services.

**Overview of Services**

There are two levels of support services:

### 4. Description of Support Program

#### Accessing Technical Support

TuxCare Technical Support is designed for enterprise clients with trained IT staff which provide initial ‘1st-line' support to triage incidents. Customer and TuxCare will agree on Customer Technical Leads with the client, who will be entitled to access TuxCare Technical Support services; Customer Technical Leads must complete AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux training requirements. Customer Technical Leads may submit Technical Support Incidents and Service Requests to:

1. Technical Support ticketing system: [https://tuxcare.com/support-portal/](https://tuxcare.com/support-portal/)

* Acceptance of requests 24 hours a day, 365 days a year
* Unlimited number of tickets may be submitted
* Customers will be supplied with instructions describing the use of the ticketing system during onboarding
* User accounts will be created for each nominated user within each client organization
* User accounts will have access to log, view and respond to tickets

2. Email: acceptance of requests 24 hours a day, 365 days a year:

* New tickets may be created by simply emailing the support desk: [support@tuxcare.com](support@tuxcare.com)

:::warning
If you are a user of our server product AMI's on AWS Marketplace, before you contact support, you should have your AWS accountId to hand, there are various ways to find it.

If you have the aws cli tool installed on your computer, you can run:

```text
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text

123456789012
```

Alternatively you can make a request to the AWS API from within a running instance, as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html#retrieve-iid), for example using IMDSv1:

```text
$ curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | grep accountId

  "accountId" : "123456789012",
```

Or if you have access to the [ec2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) you can simply click your username at the top right of the page. Your Account ID is the 12 digits in the dropdown.
:::

All customers are entitled to access the Support knowledgebase, FAQs, and other self-service tools as may be offered by TuxCare Enterprise Support.

#### Response Time

When submitting a ticket, Customers will select the appropriate Severity Level, as defined in Appendix A, from a drop-down list; TuxCare reserves the right to change the Severity Level based on available information. TuxCare will use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests within the initial response times described below, based on the Severity Level of the incident.

|Severity Level|Essential Support|Enhanced Support|
|------|:------|:------|
|1|2 hours|30 minutes|
|2|12 hours|2 hours|
|3|2 business days|12 hours|
|4|5 business days|2 business days|

#### Incident Resolution Cooperation

Some incidents may require reproduction by TuxCare for the purpose of testing and verifying a product error. Customer agrees to provide TuxCare with all information which may be necessary for reproducing the condition under which the incident will re-occur and could be examined.

TuxCare will endeavor to reproduce the incident as soon as all the necessary information and software and/or hardware is provided. If the incident could not be reproduced, Customer should grant TuxCare a supervised remote access to the malfunctioning system. If the incident cannot be reproduced by either party, or Customer did not grant access to the network environment where the incident could be reproduced, or if it is detected that the incident's cause lies beyond the Product, the incident cannot be classified within this Support Program.

An incident may at any time be either on the Customer's side (i.e. Customer is taking actions that will promote/expedite the resolution of the issue by TuxCare) or on the AlmaLinux side. An incident is on the Customer's side when TuxCare engineers request information from the Customer. When Customer provides the requested information to TuxCare, the incident is considered to be on the side of the latter. The period during which the incident may be on the Customer's side is limited to one calendar week. If the Customer's response is overdue, the incident is closed by timeout.

### Appendices

#### Appendix B: Quality management

**Incident escalation**

Customer may escalate unresolved incidents or reports of dissatisfaction according to the following scheme:

|Escalation Level|1|2|3|
|------|------|---|---|
|Escalation Path|Technical Senior Support Engineer|Specialized Support Team Lead or Manager|Chief Experience Officer (CXO)|

**Provision of reports on open incidents**

During the process of incident resolution, TuxCare will use reasonable effort to promptly provide the Customer with information regarding open incidents' status, according to the following table.

|Severity Level|Report Schedule (through the web ticketing system)|
|------|------|
|1|By agreement, but not more often than once a day|
|2|At least once every 3 business days|
|3|At least once every 2 weeks|
|4|Upon customer request|

**Limitations of the Support Services**

Technical support covered by any of the TuxCare Support Programs shall not be provided in the following cases:

* Incidents already resolved for the Customer (e.g., an incident that occurred on one installed copy of the Product after the same incident had been resolved for another copy of the Product)
* Troubleshooting of all issues similar or identical to already resolved issues (i.e. the incidents to which a previously produced solution can be applied without additional guidance from TuxCare)
* Incidents caused by Customer's hardware malfunction
* Incidents caused by software platform incompatibility (including, but not limited to beta software, new versions of service packs or additions, whose compatibility with the Product has not been confirmed with AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux)
* Incidents caused by installing and running third-party applications (including, but not limited to the list of unsupported or incompatible applications published in the documentation)
* Incidents for which the Customer cannot provide accurate information, as reasonably requested by TuxCare, in order to reproduce, investigate, and resolve the incident
* Incidents which arise as a result of neglect or incorrect use of TuxCare instructions, which, if properly used, would have prevented the Incident

### Installing tuxctl (Essential Support)

Similarly to the ESU instructions [above](/enterprise-support-for-almalinux/#installing-tuxctl), Essential Support customers should install tuxcare-release and register their server using tuxctl. The main difference is the choice of OS version - you must install the RPM specifically for your AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux version, currently 8.8, 8.10, 9.2, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 10.0 and 10.1 are supported.

If you are unsure, run this to find your exact OS version:

```text
$ cat /etc/almalinux-release

AlmaLinux release 8.10 (Cerulean Leopard)
```

Or:

```text
cat /etc/rocky-release

Rocky Linux release 9.6 (Blue Onyx)
```

You can browse [https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/](https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/) and find the correct RPM, or you can figure it out by substituting the version number (8.8, 8.10, 9.2, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 10.0 or 10.1) then install it as root, for example, choose one of these:

For 8.10:

```text
# dnf -y install https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/tuxcare-release-latest-8.10.noarch.rpm
```

For 9.7:

```text
# dnf -y install https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/tuxcare-release-latest-9.7.noarch.rpm
```

For 10.1:

```text
# dnf -y install https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/tuxcare-release-latest-10.1.noarch.rpm
```

:::warning
Be aware that installing tuxcare-release will modify any files that match the wildcard `/etc/yum.repos.d/almalinux*.repo` and `/etc/yum.repos.d/rocky*.repo`
:::

The second step is to activate your license on the system. You should run the `tuxctl` tool as root with your Essential Support license key provided as a command line argument like so:

```text
# tuxctl --license-key XXXXXXXXXX
```

:::warning
If you get a status code 403:

```text
Errors during downloading metadata for repository 'tuxcare-esu'
```

Then you are using an Essential Support license key for an Extended Security Updates release (9.2, 9.6 or 9.10) and can disable the ESU repository using:

```text
dnf config-manager --set-disabled tuxcare-esu
```

ESU customers can find instructions [above](/enterprise-support-for-almalinux/#installing-tuxctl)
:::

**Managing license usage**

To check if a server is already activated, you can run `tuxctl` and check for return code 0:

```text
# tuxctl -v
Server is registered with token <blah>
```

Or if not registered you will get a return code 1:

```text
# tuxctl -v
Server is not registered
```

If you are decommissioning a server and would like to de-register its license, you can run `tuxctl` like this and check for return code 0:

```text
# tuxctl -d
De-registration successful
```

**Upgrading**

Essential Support customers can upgrade to a new minor version, for example from 9.6 to 9.7 by editing the /etc/dnf/vars/tuxcare_releasever file to specify the new version, like so:

```text
# echo 9.7 > /etc/dnf/vars/tuxcare_releasever
# dnf upgrade
```
