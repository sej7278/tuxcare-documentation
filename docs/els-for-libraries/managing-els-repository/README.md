# Managing the ELS repository

This page provides instructions for upgrading to newer TuxCare package versions and accessing source code for ELS-patched libraries.

## How to Upgrade to a Newer Version

<TableTabs label="Choose the Ecosystem: " >

<template #Java>

If you have already installed a package with a `tuxcare.1` suffix and want to upgrade to a newer release (for example, `tuxcare.3`), update the version string in your Maven or Gradle build file with the version listed in your TuxCare Nexus account.

</template>

<template #PHP>

If you have already installed a TuxCare-patched package and want to upgrade to a newer release, update the version string in your `composer.json` file or run the `composer require` command with the new version.

<ELSSteps>

1. Update the required version

   Replace `VENDOR/PACKAGE` with the package name and `VERSION-pN+tuxcare` with the version listed in your TuxCare Nexus account:

   ```text
   composer require VENDOR/PACKAGE:VERSION-pN+tuxcare
   ```

2. Apply the changes

   Run `composer update` to resolve dependencies and install the new release:

   ```text
   composer update
   ```

</ELSSteps>

**Check the exact version listed in your TuxCare Nexus account to ensure you receive the most recent patched release.**

</template>

<template #Python>

To upgrade to a newer TuxCare release (for example, from `version.post1+tuxcare` to `version.post2+tuxcare`), use the same installation method you used during setup and specify the newer package version listed in your TuxCare Nexus account.

</template>

<template #JavaScript>

To upgrade to a newer TuxCare release (for example, from `tuxcare.1` to `tuxcare.3`), remove `node_modules`, clear the npm cache to avoid conflicts, and then run the installation command:

```text
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

</template>

## Source code

Source code is currently available for TuxCare-patched **Java** libraries. Source JARs follow the standard Maven naming convention with a `-sources` classifier and are published to the [Nexus repository](https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/#browse/browse:els_java).

For example: [https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els_java/commons-lang/commons-lang/2.6-tuxcare.1/commons-lang-2.6-tuxcare.1-sources.jar](https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els_java/commons-lang/commons-lang/2.6-tuxcare.1/commons-lang-2.6-tuxcare.1-sources.jar).
